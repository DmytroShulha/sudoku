# ADR 010: Theming & Design System

## Metadata
* **Status:** ACCEPTED
* **Date:** 2026-01-30
* **Deciders:** Dmytro Shulha
* **Stakeholders Consulted:** N/A

## 1. Context (The Forces)
A Sudoku game requires high visual clarity and user-customizable themes to ensure comfort during long play sessions. We need a system that supports Light/Dark modes and modern Android styling.

* **Business:** Provide a modern, professional-looking UI that can adapt to user preferences (accessibility/aesthetics).
* **Technological:** Adoption of Material 3 (M3). Support for Dynamic Color (Material You) on Android 12+.
* **Project-local:** Integration with the `PersonalTheme` Composable.

## 2. Options Considered
* **Option 1: Material 3 with Dynamic Color Support**
    * **Pros/Cons:** Modern look, automatic color extraction from wallpaper, robust set of UI components. However, requires handling fallbacks for older Android versions.
* **Option 2: Material 2 (Classic)**
    * **Pros/Cons:** More stable and familiar, but lacks modern features like Dynamic Color and has a dated "Look and Feel" compared to current OS standards.
* **Option 3: Custom Design System**
    * **Pros/Cons:** Maximum brand identity. However, it requires significant development effort to build basic components (buttons, sliders, etc.) from scratch.

## 3. Decision Outcome
**Chosen Option: Material 3 with Dynamic Color Support**

* **Rationale:** Material 3 is the current standard for Android. Using it allows us to leverage modern APIs like `dynamicLightColorScheme` while providing a consistent experience. We also implemented custom toggles for Dark/Light mode and System-default tracking.
* **Implementation Details:**
    * **PersonalTheme:** A custom wrapper around `MaterialTheme` that handles theme switching logic.
    * **SudokuBoardTheme:** A domain-level entity that persists user theme preferences.

## 4. Consequences
* **{+} Positive:** High-quality, accessible UI components out of the box.
* **{+} Positive:** Native integration with system-level dark mode and wallpaper colors.
* **{-} Negative:** Material 3 is more complex than Material 2 and can occasionally introduce breaking changes in newer library versions.

## 5. Validation & Compliance
* Verify that all new UI components use colors from `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` instead of hardcoded hex values.
