# ADR 000: App Architecture

## Metadata
* **Status:** ACCEPTED
* **Date:** 2026-01-28
* **Deciders:** Dmytro Shulha
* **Stakeholders Consulted:** N/A

## 1. Context (The Forces)
The project starts with simple requirements to create a basic Sudoku game. We need an architecture that is easy to start with but allows for growth without excessive boilerplate initially.

* **Business:** Need to launch a functional Sudoku game quickly with simple requirements.
* **Technological:** Android development using Kotlin.
* **Project-local:** Small initial codebase.

## 2. Options Considered
* **Option 1: Package-based Clean Architecture**
  * **Pros:** Low overhead, easy to navigate, good separation of concerns for small to medium projects.
* **Option 2: Multi-module Clean Architecture**
  * **Pros:** Better isolation, potentially faster build times for very large projects.
  * **Cons:** High initial boilerplate and complexity for a simple app.

## 3. Decision Outcome
**Chosen Option: Package-based Clean Architecture**

* **Rationale:** We adopted a simple architecture similar to Clean, but separated by packages instead of modules. This matches the current project scale (Social/Project-local force) while providing a path for expansion.
* **Rejected Options:** Multi-module architecture was rejected because it introduces unnecessary complexity and overhead for the current "small+" project scope.

## 4. Consequences
* **{+} Positive:** Easy to maintain.
* **{+} Positive:** Easy to expand in case the project code grows.
* **{-} Negative:** At the moment, this approach is best suited for small to "small+" projects; isolation is not as strict as with modules.
* **{!} Risks/Tech Debt:** If the project grows significantly, we may need to revisit the decision and migrate to a multi-module structure.

## 5. Validation & Compliance
* Code reviews to ensure architectural layers (data, domain, presentation) are respected.
