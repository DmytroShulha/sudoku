# ADR 007: Navigation Strategy

## Metadata
* **Status:** ACCEPTED
* **Date:** 2026-01-30
* **Deciders:** Dmytro Shulha
* **Stakeholders Consulted:** N/A

## 1. Context (The Forces)
With a multi-screen app (Main Menu, Game, Settings, Statistics, About), we need a robust way to navigate between screens and pass arguments (like game difficulty).

* **Business:** Need for smooth transitions and a logical app flow.
* **Technological:** Using Jetpack Compose. Traditional Fragment-based navigation is possible but adds complexity in a pure Compose project.
* **Project-local:** Integration with the existing Compose-based UI.

## 2. Options Considered
* **Option 1: Jetpack Compose Navigation**
  * **Pros/Cons:** Official Google library, designed for Compose, supports deep linking and Type-safe navigation (in newer versions). Integration with ViewModel is seamless.
* **Option 2: Manual State-based Navigation**
  * **Pros/Cons:** Full control, no extra libraries. However, it requires significant boilerplate for backstack management and argument passing.
* **Option 3: Third-party Libraries (e.g., Voyager, Decompose)**
  * **Pros/Cons:** Often offer better APIs or multi-platform support. However, they add external dependencies and might have a different lifecycle model than the standard Android one.

## 3. Decision Outcome
**Chosen Option: Jetpack Compose Navigation**

* **Rationale:** It is the standard for Compose apps, well-documented, and integrates perfectly with the Android Lifecycle and Koin ViewModels. It handles the backstack out of the box.
* **Rejected Options:** Manual navigation was rejected due to the complexity of backstack management. Third-party libraries were rejected to stay within the standard AndroidX ecosystem for this project.

## 4. Consequences
* **{+} Positive:** Standard implementation that most Android developers are familiar with.
* **{+} Positive:** Good integration with `NavController` and `NavHost`.
* **{-} Negative:** String-based routing (in older versions) can be error-prone; requires careful management of route constants.

## 5. Validation & Compliance
* All navigation events should be handled via a `NavController`.
* Routes should be defined in a centralized place (e.g., `SudokuRoutes`).
