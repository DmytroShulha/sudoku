# ADR 003: UI Framework

## Metadata
* **Status:** ACCEPTED
* **Date:** 2026-01-30
* **Deciders:** Dmytro Shulha
* **Stakeholders Consulted:** N/A

## 1. Context (The Forces)
The project requires a modern, responsive, and maintainable user interface. We need to decide between the traditional View-based system (XML) and the modern declarative toolkit.

* **Business:** Need for high developer productivity and a polished user experience.
* **Technological:** The industry is moving towards declarative UI. Android's official recommendation is Jetpack Compose.
* **Project-local:** A new project with no legacy UI code, allowing for a clean start with modern tools.

## 2. Options Considered
* **Option 1: XML / View System (Traditional)**
  * **Pros/Cons:** Mature tooling and wide community knowledge, but involves significant boilerplate, imperative code, and fragile state synchronization between XML and Kotlin/Java.
* **Option 2: Jetpack Compose (Modern, Declarative)**
  * **Pros/Cons:** Declarative syntax, reduces boilerplate, easier state management, and better integration with Kotlin features. However, it has a learning curve and requires modern Android Studio versions.

## 3. Decision Outcome
**Chosen Option: Jetpack Compose**

* **Rationale:** Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development and maintenance. Its declarative nature aligns perfectly with the state-driven requirements of a Sudoku game, where the UI must constantly react to changes in the board state.
* **Rejected Options:** XML was rejected because it leads to more boilerplate code (ViewBinding, manual state updates) and is considered the legacy way of building Android UIs for new projects.

## 4. Consequences
* **{+} Positive:** Significantly less code compared to XML.
* **{+} Positive:** Reactive UI that automatically updates when state changes.
* **{+} Positive:** Faster UI prototyping and more reusable components.
* **{-} Negative:** Requires the team to be proficient in declarative UI concepts.
* **{!} Risks/Tech Debt:** Compose performance can be sensitive to unnecessary recompositions if not optimized correctly.

## 5. Validation & Compliance
* All new UI components must be built using Jetpack Compose.
* Use Compose Previews to verify UI during development.
